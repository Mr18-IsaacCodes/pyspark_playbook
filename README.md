# pyspark_sql_playbook

Welcome to the **pyspark_sql_playbook** repository! This repository contains a collection of PySpark and SQL-based code examples, playbooks, and solutions for real-world data engineering tasks, including data processing, transformation, aggregations, and performance optimizations.

## Overview

This repository provides reusable and extendable solutions for big data processing tasks using both PySpark and SQL. It includes playbooks for the following operations:

- Data transformations using PySpark
- SQL-based data querying, manipulation, and optimizations
- Aggregations, filtering, and analysis using both PySpark and SQL
- Performance tuning and optimization techniques in PySpark and SQL


## PySpark Transformations

This section contains PySpark-based examples for various data transformations such as:

- Filtering
- Grouping and aggregation
- Joining datasets
- Handling missing data
- UDF (User Defined Functions) usage

## SQL Queries and Operations

Here you'll find SQL-based examples for manipulating and analyzing data using:

- SQL SELECT queries
- JOIN operations in SQL
- Window functions
- Complex aggregations
- Subqueries and common table expressions (CTEs)

## Performance Optimizations

This section focuses on performance tuning and optimization strategies in both PySpark and SQL:

- Partitioning and caching techniques
- Query optimization in SparkSQL
- Using broadcast joins effectively
- Reducing data shuffle
- Tuning Spark configurations for better performance
